This contains the files for building the EMR project. Flying Orders are to evolved by all flying units whenever situation demands. They are in addition to any established AFM, SOP, Check List etc. Flying Orders are not to be repetative, but certain complementary repetition may be made only in illustrating a new or modified item. An item of any AFO which is related to flying, may be promulgated as a flying order if it is not already repeated in the SOP. These orders are to be obeyed by ali personnel flying in that unit.
